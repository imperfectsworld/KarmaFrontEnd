      <h2>About WeeGive</h2>
      <p class="mission-statement">"Wee-duce, Wee-use, Wee-cycle" - Our mission is to help families care for their little ones while caring for the planet.</p>

      <p>At WeeGive, our mission is simple: to help families care for their little ones while caring for the planet. By providing a platform where people can share gently used baby goods, we aim to foster a sense of community, reduce waste, and ensure that essential baby items get a second life.</p>

      <h4>Our Story</h4>
      <p>WeeGive was born from the collective vision of three passionate developers: Afseen Salam, DeAngelo Robinson, and David Goodwin, who met at the Grand Circus coding bootcamp. During their time together, they collaborated on several innovative web applications. The inspiration for WeeGive came when one of the founders, a new parent, struggled to find an affordable and sustainable way to provide for their baby’s needs. This sparked the idea of creating a platform where parents and caregivers could easily share baby goods.</p>

      <h4>How It Works</h4>
      <p>WeeGive allows users to:</p>
      <ul class="list-group list-group-flush text-start">
        <li class="list-group-item"> <strong>Post an Item</strong>: Have baby goods you no longer need? Upload a description, photo, and your location to list it for others in your community.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Inquire About an Item</strong>: See something your family could use? Send a message to the poster to coordinate a pick-up or delivery.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Sustainable Sharing</strong>: Every item shared through WeeGive helps reduce waste and supports a greener future for our children.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Our Commitment</h4>
      <p>We believe in building stronger communities by making it easier for families to support each other. Whether you’re passing on clothes that no longer fit or finding the perfect crib for your newborn, WeeGive is here to help you reduce costs and your carbon footprint. Together, we can make the world a better place for the next generation—one baby item at a time.</p>
